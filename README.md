# Today in this modern era social media is the most common way of communication. We have
numerous sites, applications and tools that can be used in various ways which can be point to
point or one to many. There was a time when any person wanted to share his views or thoughts
he has to approach to the radio operator or any local dailies .But with the advancement of
technology we have got an efficient solution for it, that is blogging. In the resent days blogging
has caught a lot of eyes. In this project we are building a micro blogging site that will help the
user to create his blogs, articles and thoughts and share them in the social platform through this
blogging site. This site is not only helping the user to post his blogs but also would help him in
viewing the work of other users. Hence, building this site we have tried to elucidate and improve
the blogging experience of the users.
